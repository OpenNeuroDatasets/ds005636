This dataset contains raw in vivo T2 weighted and resting state fMRI images aquired from C58/J mice (a model of restricted, repetitive behavior) at 6-7 weeks postweaning following post-weaning exposure to either standard housing or environmental enrichment housing. Both female and male mice are included. MRI images were acquired using a Magnex Scientific 11.1 T scanner at the University of Florida's Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy (AMRIS) Facility. Additional study details are provided in the citation below.
